# Online Image Converter: Local & Global Access with Future Scalability
This Online Image Converter is designed for both local and global access, with room for future feature expansion. It consists of two main components:

Backend (Flask): The Flask backend handles all image conversion tasks, such as grayscale, edge detection, and contour detection, ensuring efficient processing and results.

Frontend (Streamlit): The user-friendly Streamlit frontend allows users to upload images, select conversions, and view results seamlessly, interacting with the Flask-powered backend.

This simple system serves as a learning tool for understanding the integration of frontend (Streamlit) and backend (Flask), offering a scalable foundation for future enhancements. While basic, it ensures high performance and scalability for both local and global use.
